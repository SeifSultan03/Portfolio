            <h2>Drawing Battles</h2>
            <p>
                Drawing Battles is an online web game, which was created as a fun passion project. The game includes many features,
                where players create a room for friends to join using <span>websockets (Socket.io)</span>, and choose between randomly generated drawing topics and they compete
                to create the best drawing (voted upon in the end). The backend was developed using <span>Node.js</span>, while the frontend
                was created using plain <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>HTML</span>, and <span>CSS</span>
